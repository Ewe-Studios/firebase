# Firebase
Firebase provides a clear, clonable project template and docker image setup that easily allows you setup
a development environment for running your firebase development from.

It takes steps detailed in https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/install_and_configure for setting these up and
makes your life simpler so you can quickly move towards building your product than dealing with local development setup.

## Setup

1. Copy `firebase` directory from `example` into your project.

2. Copy `docker-compose.yml` from `example` into your project.

3. Copy `Makefile` from `example` into your project.

4. Run `make setup` to setup firebase functions files.
